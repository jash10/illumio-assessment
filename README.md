a.I made an excel file with all the test cases. If you want to test the code on more test cases,you can append that to the excel file.

To complile the code,type the following command:
javac firewall.java

To run my code,type the command:
java firewall


b.I followed the object oriented design which is the main feature of Java.
  
  The standard algorithm which is mentioned in the document for filtering of the packets is used.
  
c. I think the time suggested that is 1-2 hours for completing the challenge was sufficient enough.
  Thus,I would think that any other refinement or optimizations are not required.
  
d.Please keep the excel and Firewall.java file in the same directory while compiling the code.
